# Iris-flower-classification-project-using-SVM

 > The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification.I have used **SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE(SVM)** here The project make use of      Scikit-Learn and Pandas Libraries.
 > Distinguishing the species of some iris flowers by considering some measurements associated with each iris, which are: 
 - The length and width of the petals 
 - The length and width of the sepals
