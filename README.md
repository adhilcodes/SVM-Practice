# iris-flower-classification-project-using-SVM
Distinguishing the species of some iris flowers by considering some measurements associated with each iris, which are: The length and width of the petals The length and width of the sepals, all measured in centimetres. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species are already known,  so that we can predict the species for the new irises that she has found.
